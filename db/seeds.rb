Many more great tips here
One very powerful, but undocumented, search tool, is the AROUND function. If you wanted to research Barack Obama's interactions with Australia, you could simply include both terms in a search, but you'd find thousands of articles in which these two terms may appear many paragraphs apart, and bear no relation to one another.
But if instead you search \"obama\" AROUND(10) \"australia\" then the first results will be one in which Obama appears within ten words of Australia. NOTE: for this to work, both search terms must be in quotes, AROUND must be capitalized, and the number must be in parentheses.
Knowing how and when to use the minus sign in a search query. i.e. search George Washington -gwu.edu
Also ~ before a word to search simultaneously for the synonyms of that word.
<number>..<number> to search for a range of numbers. For example, 1..10
(*) as a wildcard in quoted search strings to stand for one or many unknown words. \"The * cat\" will return things like The angry cat, the big brown cat...
(+) will ensure that a word is included in every search result. (per u/izerth, google got rid of the + operator, so now you have to put \" around single words or use search tools->results->verbatim)
Quotes surrounding a phrase will ensure that exact phrase turns up.
filetype: .whatever will make sure URLs have that extension at the end.
inurl: some.words_here will make sure whatever follows shows up in the URL. Good for refining your search by domain name.
site:sitename.com will return only results from that site", author_id: 1, notebook_id: 1, archived: true);
